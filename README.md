# WhereWeEating
App uses input of locations and a random spinner to determine the never ending question of "Where are we eating?" 

#Initial Plan 
- Create spin and arrow functions
- Take Unlimited options from the user until they've entered all the locations. 
- Calculate % of the pie needed per option. 
- User clicks "spin"  
- Random Number Generated between 1 and userOption.length 
- Numbers 1 - length are assigned to User Options. 
- Arrow Spins 
- Arrow Ends on Random Number Option. 

- Congrats ... Looks like it really is Taco Tuesday!
